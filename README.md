Settings
--------

By default, all aliases are defined with a `g` prefix, as you can see above. But
some of the default aliases may shadow system commands, like `gpt` for the GUID
partition table maintenance utility.

You can temporarily bypass an alias by prefixing it with a backward slash:
`\gpt`.

Or you can use the following zstyle if you wish to customize the prefix used to
define all aliases:

    zstyle ':zim:git' aliases-prefix 'G'

Functions
---------

  * `git-branch-current` displays the current branch.
  * `git-branch-delete-interactive` asks for confirmation to also delete the
    upstream remote branch(es).
  * `git-dir` displays the path to the Git directory.
  * `git-ignore-add` adds any arguments to the .gitignore in the project root.
  * `git-root` displays the path to the working tree root.
  * `git-stash-clear-interactive` asks for confirmation before clearing the stash.
  * `git-stash-recover` recovers given dropped stashed states.
  * `git-submodule-move` moves a submodule.
  * `git-submodule-remove` removes a submodule.
