Settings
--------

By default, all aliases are defined with an upper case `G` prefix, as you can
see above. You can use the following zstyle if you wish to customize the prefix
used to generate all aliases:

    zstyle ':zim:git' aliases-prefix 'g'

Add the zstyle to your `~/.zshrc` before where the module is initialized.

Be careful if changing the prefix to lower case `g`, as the generated aliases
can shadow [many](https://github.com/zimfw/git/issues/2) commands, like `gpt`
for the GUID partition table maintenance utility.

Functions
---------

  * `git-alias-lookup` lists the aliases defined here searching at the given path, by the given regular expressions.
  * `git-branch-current` displays the current branch.
  * `git-branch-delete-interactive` asks for confirmation to also delete the upstream remote branch(es).
  * `git-branch-remote-tracking` lists all local branches with none or given remote-tracking status

  * `git-dir` displays the path to the Git directory.
  * `git-ignore-add` adds any arguments to the .gitignore in the project root.
  * `git-root` displays the path to the working tree root.
  * `git-stash-clear-interactive` asks for confirmation before clearing the stash.
  * `git-stash-recover` recovers given dropped stashed states.
